										<h2>Hello.</h2>
										<p>Thank you for taking a minute to get to know me. <br/></p>
									</header>

									<p>My love of programming was discovered by accident while trying to write a rather lengthy if/then formula in Excel. At the time, I was nearing my tenth year as a Business Analyst, a career which had yet to prove itself to be entirely fulfilling. Initially, I tried to focus on the more immediate and practical applications of programming which, at that time, was SQL and a bit of VBA, as they helped automate simple tasks in my daily work.</p>

									<p>From there, I began consuming every online resource I could get my hands on, but they lacked the balanced curriculum that I knew I needed if I wanted to pursue programming as a career.</p>

									<p>This summer, I completed an in-person Full-Stack JavaScript course that allowed me to continue to explore my passion for programming. Additionally, this course offered workshops focused on Agile, testing, UI/UX, and design which I became equally passionate about. </p>

									<p>When testing, I enjoy the procedural, logic-based approach that is required to detect and diagnose defects. Having worked in a Waterfall environment before, Agile's focus on quick iteration and empirical feedback are a welcome and long overdue change for me. UI and UX speak to my creative side, as as I love the challenge associated with creating something that is both useful and beautiful.</p>

									<p>My degree in marketing instilled in me a curiosity about how to create products that can meet a customer's needs. In my work as a Business Analyst, I became accustomed to answering questions, gathering requirements, and communicating effectively across an organization. Through programming, I have uncovered a way to incorporate my professional experience and personal interests in a way I could have never imagined, and it's with this enthusiasm that I look forward to each new day. </p>

												<h4>Chinese Menu Item Pictures</h4>
												<p>I don't know about your local Chinese restaurant but every one I've been to has the exact same 10 pictures on display, and I know not one of them features their actual food. So, I built this app in hopes to source actual pictures from real-life customers with the idea that if I can see enough delicious alternatives to General Tso's Chicken, I just might decide to try something new. This <b>MEAN</b> app uses <b>mLab </b> and <b> Filestack</b> to save and serve my data.</p>

												<h4>Data Dashboards and Analysis</h4>
												<p>My years as a Business Analyst and my marketing degree have given me the ability to understand business at all levels and through a variety of stakeholder lenses. Often, the best way to communicate my findings and analysis was through the use of reports and dashboards. Here's an example of reporting done in <b>Excel</b>, the objective of which was to provide a high-level analysis of student achievement.</p>
